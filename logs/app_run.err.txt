C:\PROJECTS\hailei-3.0\app.py:180: UserWarning: You have not specified a value for the `type` parameter. Defaulting to the 'tuples' format for chatbot messages, but this is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Gradio. Please set type='messages' instead, which uses openai-style dictionaries with 'role' and 'content' keys.
