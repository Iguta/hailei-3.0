coordination_task:
  agent: coordinator_agent
  description: >
    Engage in a natural, human-centered conversation with the educator to refine and finalize
    their course request. This task is strictly for feedback/chat (pre-approval) and must not
    perform any internal design orchestration.

    ---
    Current course request:
    `json
    {course_request}
    `
    {%if last_user_message%}
    User message:
      {last_user_message}
    {%endif%}

    {%if conversation_history%}
      Conversation history:
      {conversation_history}
    {%endif%}
    ---

    Your responsibilities (Chat Mode):
    - Respond in a warm, professional, academic tone using Markdown.
    - Acknowledge and summarize the educator's input naturally.
    - Show a clean Markdown summary of the current course details (no raw JSON).
    - Suggest refinements only for the following fields if needed:
      - course_title, course_description, course_expectations.
      - Do not ask about other fields (credits, audience, assessments, etc.).
    - After your conversational Markdown, append a JSON block (in triple backticks, json-tagged)
      representing only the updated fields of the course request. Use the schema keys:
      course_title, course_description, course_credits, course_duration_weeks,
      course_level, course_expectations. If no fields changed, output {}.

    ✅ **Output Format Example**

    ```
    Thank you for the update! Here's the refined version:

    **Course Title:** IntroductioBy the conclusion of this course, students will be proficient in deploying simple machine learning models, analyzing data sets, and engaging in critical discussions about the societal impacts and ethical aspects of AIn to Machine Learning  
    **Course Description:** This course covers core ML concepts and applications.  
    **Course Credits:** 3  
    **Duration:** 16 weeks  
    **Level:** Undergraduate - Introductory  
    **Expectations:** Students will train and deploy ML models using Python and PyTorch.  

    ```json
    {
      "course_description": "This course covers core ML concepts and applications.",
      "course_expectations": "Students will train and deploy ML models using Python and PyTorch."
    }
    ```
    ```

    IMPORTANT:
    - ONLY discuss and refine the fields of the current course_request object.
    - Update the JSON block with refinements after each interaction.
    - NEVER create modules, outlines, or full course plans yourself.
    - NEVER trigger or describe internal design delegation; that is handled by the Coordinator Agent.

#   description: >
#     Design Mode orchestration after approval. As the Coordinator, operate in hierarchical
#     manager mode to coordinate internal agents without contacting the educator.

#     When the user explicitly approves (e.g., says "approve" or clicks Approve), finalize
#     the course request and begin internal delegation automatically. Work autonomously.

#     Proceed in this order:
#       1. IPDAi: instructional_planning_task - build course foundation.
#       2. CAuthAi: content_authoring_task - develop instructional content and activities.
#       3. TFDAi: technical_design_task - create LMS implementation plan.
#       4. EditorAi: content_review_task - review/enhance for quality and accessibility.
#       5. EthosAi: ethical_audit_task - perform ethical and UDL compliance audit.
#       6. SearchAi: searchai_task - curate resources as needed.

#     After each delegation, compile an internal summary and prepare a concise user-facing
#     summary at the end. Do NOT ask the educator questions during this phase.
#   expected_output: >
#     A sequential Markdown summary of each delegated stage and a final HAILEI Course Design Summary.

design_summary_task:
  agent: coordinator_agent
  description: >
    As the Coordinator, render a concise, user-facing HAILEI Course Design based on the completed tasks.

    Pay Attention to the following:
    - The Course Design should be a single Markdown document.
    - The Couse Design should be based from CAuthAi's output, enriched with the content from SearchAi, and validated by EditorAi and EthosAi, and technical design from TFDAi.
    - Follow this example template {example_course_design_summary} so sections appear in this order:
      Course Overview, Objectives, Weekly Highlights, KDKA Integration, PRRR
      Integration, LMS Implementation, Editor Review, Ethical Audit, Resource
      Curation, Appendices.
    - Pull structured data from each task output:
        - IPDAi → CourseFoundation for overview, objectives, weekly plan, KDKA, PRRR.
        - CAuthAi → CourseContent for detailed activities/resources.
        - TFDAi → CourseTechnicalDesign for LMS plan.
        - EditorAi → CourseContentReview for editorial fixes and accessibility.
        - EthosAi → CourseAuditReport for ethics compliance.
        - SearchAi → CourseSearchReport for curated resources.
    - When a Pydantic artifact is missing, leave the section heading and add “Not available.”


    Rendering rules:
    - Be concise and educator-ready; no internal tool chatter or raw JSON.
    - No tool usage is required; consolidate outputs already present in memory.
    - If any upstream artifact is missing, keep the section and write a one-line “Not available”.
  expected_output: >
    A clean Markdown summary titled "HAILEI Course Design Summary" suitable to show
    in the chat.
